                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                  Founded in 2025, Manzilini was created to address the real challenges faced by tenants, landlords, 
                  and homeowners in Kenya's real estate market. We recognized that the traditional property search and 
                  housing services process was fragmented, time-consuming, and often unreliable.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Many renters struggled with unverified listings, hidden fees, and lack of transparency. Landlords found 
                  it challenging to reach genuine tenants and manage their properties efficiently. Homeowners needed reliable 
                  access to quality home services but had to navigate multiple platforms and service providers.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Manzilini is built on the principles of convenience, transparency, and reliability. By leveraging 
                  modern technology and a user-centered design approach, we've created an integrated platform that brings 
                  together property search, listing management, secure communication, and a comprehensive ecosystem of 
                  home-related services.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Beyond property rentals, our platform offers essential services including house moving, fumigation, 
                  interior design, house management, installations, and Airbnb support—all delivered by vetted service 
                  providers. Our goal is to improve living standards, reduce inefficiencies in the housing process, 
                  and contribute to the digital transformation of the real estate sector in Kenya.
